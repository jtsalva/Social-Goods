## Help young students with their finances
A prototype web app to help young people stay on track with their finances. Ideally, a mobile app will be created that uses different innovative technologies (machine learning, data analytics) to identify potential pitfalls for students. Though, besides technology, the focus should be pointed more towards recognising the importance of managing personal finances.
